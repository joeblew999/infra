# Legacy Services

This is for non core services !!

This tree retains the pre-core packages and binaries. They remain runnable for
reference and compatibility while the deterministic core platform grows under
`core/`. New development should land in `core/pkg/...`; update this directory
only when you need to keep legacy behaviour available during the transition.
