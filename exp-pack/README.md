# Your Go Tool for packing

What things we need ?

I think this is only for packaging for

- npm, so JS devs can easily run our Infra golang system

- web, so that our system can easily run as a Serive works in a browser

- webview, so that on Mobile and Desktop, we can run the web as a webview.

Its a good idea if have this whole thing as a pkg that is aprt of infra, like the other things ? 

We will need to support signing too. if the infra binary is inclcdued in the npm thing we need it.
- also the WebView on Desktop and Mobile needs signing.
- oh boy i guess we are going to need a signing pkg too for reuse ? 
- signing for desktops is not too hard, but we need to make it easy dfor us and devs to get the right data and keys. 

## NPM Package

A Node.js/Deno/Bun wrapper for your Go binary, making it easy to install and use across JavaScript runtimes.
