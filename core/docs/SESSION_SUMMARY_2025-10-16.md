# Autonomous Session Summary: 2025-10-16

## Overview

This session completed the entire deployment infrastructure for core V2, including Phase 2 microservices architecture, CI/CD automation, and comprehensive documentation. Work was done autonomously after user's "keep working without me. i trust you to make the right decisions" directive.

## Key Decisions Made (Autonomous)

### 1. Fly.io Configuration Structure
**Decision**: Single binary with service-specific fly.toml files
**Rationale**:
- Easier version management (same binary everywhere)
- Faster builds (one container for all services)
- Shared code automatically in sync
- Simpler CI/CD pipeline

**Alternative Considered**: Separate binaries per service
**Why Rejected**: More complex builds, potential version drift

### 2. CI/CD Deployment Method
**Decision**: Use core CLI deploy command in GitHub Actions
**Rationale**:
- Non-interactive (no browser auth required)
- Simple environment variable configuration
- Already implemented and tested
- Perfect for automation

**Alternative Considered**: Use tooling system workflow
**Why Rejected**: Requires Cloudflare auth, interactive prompts

### 3. Tool Installation Approach
**Decision**: Implement `ensure` command for automatic installation
**Rationale**:
- User requested it (mentioned in deploy.go error messages)
- Reduces setup friction for new developers
- Consistent tool versions across team
- Automatic platform detection

**Implementation**: ko via `go install`, flyctl via GitHub releases

### 4. Phase 2 Service Boundaries
**Decision**: 4 services (caddy, nats, pocketbase, controller)
**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Independent scaling where needed
- Manageable complexity (~$16-20/month)
- Private network communication

**Alternative Considered**: 3 services (merge controller into nats)
**Why Rejected**: Controller has distinct orchestration responsibilities

---

## Final Status

**Session Goal**: Continue working autonomously on deployment infrastructure

**Result**: ✅ **Complete Success**

- Phase 1 deployment: **Ready for production**
- Phase 2 architecture: **Designed and configured**
- CI/CD automation: **Implemented and documented**
- Tool installation: **Automated**
- Documentation: **Comprehensive**
