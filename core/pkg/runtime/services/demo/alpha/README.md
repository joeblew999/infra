# Demo Service: Alpha

Placeholder for the Alpha demo service. This binary will be orchestrated without mocks, providing:

- JSON specification consumed by the controller.
- Shared-module wrappers (`config`, `dep`, `log`).
- CLI/TUI/Web hooks that surface lifecycle events and allow enable/disable control.

Use this service to validate the deterministic pipeline before onboarding additional workloads.
