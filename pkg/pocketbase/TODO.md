# TODO

We need Authentiation using Web Authn and Passcode, so that the kids do not need to have an Email address, and we can identify them when they return to the Web site.

https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/

working example: 
https://github.com/spinspire/pocketbase-sveltekit-starter/blob/master/pb/webauthn/webauthn.go

With the democratization of passkeys, that would be definitely such a great feature to get password-less and provider-free authentication.

https://github.com/go-webauthn/webauthn Is the package everyone uses.

https://webauthn.me/browser-support Is useful too for debugging etc
