# TODO

Each Gateway on Users phones has an AI Client, and we need to expose our MCP to them.

go-zero seems the best way to do htis.

The docs are in ./.docs/Mobile_MCP.md

https://smithery.ai might have a registry just to search.

- ahows how to instal them all into the AI clients.

https://github.com/upstash/context7 is apparently really good too. keep seeing it. Upstach is perfect for our Content creation system too. 


https://github.com/jefvangool/mcp-google-ads is highly useful in Production.
