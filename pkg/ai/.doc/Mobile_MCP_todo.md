# Mobile MCP TODO

## MCP Server Setup

Package your MCP server as an npm package or Docker container
Provide a one-liner install command: npx -y your-mcp-server
Add sample config snippet for Gemini users
Publish to Smithery registry
Create GitHub repository with README

## Web Presence

Create lightweight public site or GitHub README explaining what the MCP server does
Add /.well-known/mcp.json endpoint that returns the MCP manifest
Register domain in Google Search Console
Add sitemap.xml and submit it in Search Console
Use descriptive title and meta description tags with MCP keywords
Keep URLs short and keyword-rich like https://my-service.dev/mcp
Ensure page is mobile-first and loads fast
Host server source on GitHub with README
Publish tutorials or blog posts on Medium/Dev.to with MCP keyword
List on Smithery.ai for extra backlink

## Apple Platform

Wrap MCP server in minimal iOS app that registers one App Intent
Submit shell app to App Store with title like MyService MCP Client
Include exact phrase MCP server in description
Add .well-known/apple-app-site-association file for Spotlight deep-linking
Package as Swift Package + App Intent for future Swift Assist Store

## Payment Integration

Integrate Stripe SDK for primary payment processing
Add PayPal/Braintree integration
Implement Apple Pay sheet support for mobile users
Create checkout URL response system for MCP tools
Set up Stripe HK for cross-border CNY payments

## China Market

Develop WeChat Mini-Program wrapper for MCP calls
Create Alipay Mini-App equivalent
Register with Baidu ERNIE Bot plugin store
Set up Tencent Cloud hosting for WeChat integration
Configure Ant Cloud for Alipay services
Integrate WeChat Pay SDK for Mini-Programs
Add Alipay payment integration
Implement UnionPay QuickPass for debit fallback
Check Negative List status for software category
Evaluate WFOE vs JV requirements
Set up Hong Kong entity for cross-border operations
Research MLPS certificate requirements for data storage
Consult China-licensed attorney for regulatory compliance

## Kimi Integration

Host MCP server behind HTTPS or run locally
Add stanza to user's mcp.json configuration
Test heavy interaction patterns with Kimi model
Verify multi-turn tool chain functionality
Test streaming results and large payload handling
Validate JSON-RPC tool registration and discovery

## Technical Implementation

Import Crush Go package directly in your own Go server
Embed TUI loop or core session engine inside long-running service
Choose between keeping CLI as long-lived daemon or embedding in Go HTTP server
Instantiate one global crush.Session at server start-up
Create HTTP handler that forwards JSON-RPC to session

## Multi-Binary Management

Choose between one-process-per-binary or embed everything in one Go server
If using daemons: spawn each binary as long-running daemon on own port
If using daemons: front them with reverse proxy/multiplexer
If embedding: import all 20 packages into single Go binary
If embedding: instantiate one long-lived struct per tool at start-up
If embedding: register each under own MCP tool name
Expose single /mcp endpoint with MCP router

## Process Supervision

Pick supervisor: systemd, supervisord, or runit/s6
Create systemd unit template for all binaries
Enable all 20 binaries with loop
Add liveness endpoint /healthz to each binary
Use log aggregation to forward stdout to Loki/ELK
Expose Prometheus metrics for monitoring
Set up AlertManager for paging

## Go Supervisor Implementation

Choose between Go init replacement PID 1 or Go service supervisor
Use oklog/run library for supervisor
Static-compile your 20 binaries with CGO_ENABLED=0 go build
Static-compile the supervisor
Place binaries in /opt/crush/bin/
Ship Dockerfile or systemd unit that starts supervisor
Implement fork/exec for each binary
Capture/rotate stdout/stderr
Restart on crash or health-check failure
Expose control socket or HTTP API for stop/start/reload

## Cross-Platform Deployment

Build static executables for Windows, macOS, Linux
Embed 20 static binaries with go:embed or ship alongside
Register as Windows Service via golang.org/x/sys/windows/svc
Install as macOS LaunchDaemon
Install as Linux systemd service
Create installer scripts for each platform

## Fly.io China Strategy

Pick Fly.io region hkg for Hong Kong deployment
Enable Anycast IP with fly ips allocate-v4 --shared --region hkg
Put Tencent EdgeOne or Alibaba DCDN in front of Fly app
Expose HTTPS only on port 443
Set up HK entity + Stripe HK or Adyen HK for cross-border payments
Point DNS to both CDN edge and Fly Anycast IP with 60s TTL

## Discovery Gateways

Submit MCP manifest to Smithery today
Wrap MCP as Action and publish in OpenAI GPT Store
Register as connector for Microsoft Copilot Studio
Package as Swift Package + App Intent for Apple
Wrap MCP calls in WeChat Mini-Program for China market

## Testing

Test Stripe checkout integration end-to-end
Verify Apple Pay sheet functionality on iOS
Test WeChat Pay flow in Mini-Program environment
Validate CNY to USD settlement with Stripe HK
Test cross-border payment compliance
Stress test concurrent user sessions
Test payment gateway configuration
