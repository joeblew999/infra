# design

A fully reusable caddy package to make running caddy easy and confgi idempotent.

we invoke caddy at runtime and it generates the caddyfile. We are idempotent, with even the caddy binary being installed as needed.

We have presets, so any main.go can ask for a caddy file with certain reverse proxies.  These will evolve over time into certain pattrns for how we typcially use Caddy. By using this, we are DRY, and so when we change it here, everything using this pkg gets those changes.


standard compression ? brottli ?

example... 

examples can then use this, so they are under HTTPS, which is needed for most things like Passkyes, etc to really work.

- example now fully works.
- we test usng MCP, but i think we need a main_test.go in the example that uses rod.go, to ensure the paths and ports all works as intented.

--

fly..

we need to get it running on fly also so we can run many subsysrtsms there. See: https://www.kimi.com/share/d2cn4l0c86sc1vsvl050
- i suspect that this may be another preset, but maybe not.
- pkg/workflow will likely need to call pkg/caddy so everything is idempotent.

## TODO: Fly.io Deployment Support

The caddy package currently works well for local development and basic deployment scenarios, but we need to enhance it for production Fly.io deployment:

1. **Fly.io Preset Configuration**: Create a specialized preset that handles Fly.io's networking requirements
2. **Volume Mounting**: Ensure .data/caddy/ pattern works with Fly.io volume mounts
3. **Certificate Management**: Handle automatic HTTPS certificates in Fly.io environment vs local development
4. **Multi-app Routing**: Support routing between multiple Fly.io apps in the same organization
5. **Health Checks**: Integrate with Fly.io's health check requirements
6. **Deployment Integration**: pkg/workflow integration for automated Caddy configuration deployment

we naturally have many services running on many ports. pkg/gops is what we use to manage ports etc. It needs more wokr i think, because we are not really usng the power of gops that well. I imaging that to be idemmpotent, we want to kill anything on a port, because we start it up on that same port ?
