# nats

We run a few different nats setups from here.

This is one of the things we starup early, because everything else needs it.

NATS Leaf node that is embedded.

NATS Cluster that we need for the global system for Fault tolerance.

NATS S3 is kind of an experiment. Not sure its a smart thing yet because it will use a ton of disk space. 

- I am thinking of a S3 agnsotic system where the Users can pick an S3 cloud, and we do the setup of it for them.
