We need a binary, and we need to build this binary, and then have it usable. This is kind of weird, because then the Dep system will pull that binary, so i guess we have a 2 stage thing ?

either way, we will have NATS, that can see everything, control the scaling up and down of Servers based on demand, so that we can do follow the sun provisioning.

## domaisn and routing

this is differnet problem.

The browser will need to know the nearest server, so we will use Cloudflare domains and its anycast system, but we need to be constantly telling Cloudflare the IP of ALL our Servers, when we scqle servers up or down. Not sure if we need to use their tunnel or not to do this, or we can tell Cloudflare as we change things.
