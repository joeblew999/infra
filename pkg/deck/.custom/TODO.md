# TODO - pkg/deck Improvements

This package implements deck presentation generation based on the original [ajstarks/deck](https://github.com/ajstarks/deck) source found in `.source/deck/cmd/`. The renderers are adapted from the original implementations but still need several enhancements to achieve full feature parity.

## Completed âœ…

- âœ… **Font Integration**: All renderers use pkg/font exclusively for portable font loading
- âœ… **Comprehensive Color Handling**: Full SVG color names, RGB, hex, and HSV support via colorlookup()  
- âœ… **PNG Renderer Rewrite**: Complete rewrite based on `.source/deck/cmd/pngdeck/pngdeck.go`
- âœ… **PDF Renderer Enhancement**: Based on `.source/deck/cmd/pdfdeck/pdfdeck.go` patterns
- âœ… **Shared Constants**: Centralized constants to match original deck source values
- âœ… **Layer-based Rendering**: Proper rendering order for all formats
- âœ… **Basic Shape Support**: Rectangles, ellipses, lines, basic text rendering
- âœ… **Source Update Command**: `infra deck update-source` command to keep `.source` repositories up-to-date

## High Priority ðŸ”´

we have to work out how we want to do tests and the test data and goldens. It maybe there the 2 examples actualyl have inputs and outputs that match inside the .source code. That would be very luck if it were ??       

you mention "when pkg/font fails". Why should it ? google fonts used in the pkg/fonts is a huge corpus ? 

We have to ask the question. What IF we just used the deck code, and compiled it to Bianry and wasm, and pipelned the 2 togehter ? It might be a better apprach. This is what the .old code does !!! We need to decide based on effort. We might be reinventng the wheel too much ?

We could still use our pkg/fonts trick. We might have to parse the dekcsh and deckxml and see the fonts used. But i think in the original deck code, you pass the fonts in on the CLI ?

## Notes

- All implementations should closely follow the patterns in `.source/deck/cmd/`
- Priority should be given to PNG renderer improvements as it's the most commonly used format
- SVG renderer needs the most work to match original svgdeck functionality  
- Font integration with pkg/font is working but needs better error handling
- Color system is now comprehensive and matches original deck source exactly
