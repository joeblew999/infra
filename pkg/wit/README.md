Where are the server binaries for quickwit ? I need an URL to grab the binaries from as https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit does not have them as releases !

https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/releases

Direct Download URLs
Based on the installer script and release information, here are the direct URLs for Quickwit binaries:
Latest Version (0.8.2):

Linux x86_64: https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/releases/download/v0.8.2/quickwit-v0.8.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

Linux ARM64: https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/releases/download/v0.8.2/quickwit-v0.8.2-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

macOS x86_64: https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/releases/download/v0.8.2/quickwit-v0.8.2-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz

macOS ARM64: https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/releases/download/v0.8.2/quickwit-v0.8.2-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz

The URL pattern for any version is:
https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/releases/download/v{VERSION}/quickwit-v{VERSION}-{ARCH}.tar.gz

Where:

{VERSION} = version number (like 0.8.2)
{ARCH} = architecture (like x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)

The binaries are there in the releases, they're just packaged as .tar.gz files rather than individual executable downloads. Each release contains the pre-compiled binaries for all supported platforms.
