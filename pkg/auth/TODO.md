example can boot real NATS embedded server. Might help ?

---

need to easy test on mobile from Laptop. 

- need robust way, because we will need this for all of project.

when a suer is on many devices, we know it because ot NATS, so cant we broadcast to them all, to say what is going on. Like when you try to login on a 2nd device. I guess this is called presense system ? 

Cloudflare Tunnel is perfect for this! Here's the approach:

  Problem: Mobile can't reach localhost:8443 + WebAuthn requires real domains

  Solution: Cloudflare Tunnel creates secure tunnel from your domain → laptop

  Setup:
  1. Install cloudflared on laptop (we can add to pkg/dep)
  2. Create tunnel: cloudflared tunnel create auth-dev
  3. Point tunnel to localhost:8443
  4. DNS: auth-dev.yourdomain.com → tunnel
  5. Update WebAuthn origins from localhost to auth-dev.yourdomain.com

  Benefits:
  - ✅ Real HTTPS domain (WebAuthn requirement)
  - ✅ No port forwarding needed
  - ✅ Secure tunnel (not exposed to internet)
  - ✅ Mobile can access via real URL
  - ✅ Works with Touch ID/Face ID on iOS

  Alternative: ngrok, but Cloudflare Tunnel is better since you have CF domains

  WebAuthn config change needed:
  RPOrigins: []string{"https://auth-dev.yourdomain.com"}

  Want me to add cloudflared to pkg/dep and create a helper for tunnel setup?

> so you need a domain to use ?
