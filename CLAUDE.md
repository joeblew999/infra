# Infrastructure Management Repository

This repository manages infrastructure using Taskfiles and Terraform/OpenTofu for container orchestration and cloud deployments, plus a DataStar-based web interface.

Use the Taskfiles as much as possible.

## Claude AI Context Files

This repository contains specialized Claude AI context files for different components:

- **[CLAUDE_taskfile.md](./CLAUDE_taskfile.md)** - Taskfile development patterns, component architecture, and best practices

- **[CLAUDE_datastar.md](./CLAUDE_datastar.md)** - DataStar UI development patterns, component architecture, and best practices for the web interface
- **[CLAUDE_datastarui.md](./CLAUDE_datastarui.md)** - DataStarUI component library guidance (referenced by web/README.md)

When working on all development and operations tasks, automatically reference these files for detailed guidance on DataStar patterns, component development, and UI best practices.
