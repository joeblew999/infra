# Issue: Inconsistent code generation comments in goctl-generated files

## Summary
goctl generates some files with proper Go generation comments (`// Code generated by goctl. DO NOT EDIT.`) but omits these comments from other generated files, creating inconsistency and confusion about which files are safe to edit.

## Current Behavior
When running `goctl api go -api example.api -dir .`, the generation comments are inconsistent:

✅ **Files WITH generation comments:**
- `internal/types/types.go`
```go
// Code generated by goctl. DO NOT EDIT.
// goctl 1.8.5
```

❌ **Files WITHOUT generation comments:**
- `internal/handler/*.go` 
- `internal/config/config.go`
- `mcpserver.go` (main file)
- `internal/svc/servicecontext.go`

## Expected Behavior
All generated files should have clear, consistent generation comments following Go community standards.

## Proposed Solution
Add appropriate generation comments to all goctl-generated files, with different comments for different file types:

### Always Regenerated Files
Files that are completely regenerated on each `goctl` run:
```go
// Code generated by goctl. DO NOT EDIT.
// goctl 1.8.5
```

### Scaffolded Files  
Files that are generated once but safe to customize:
```go
// Code scaffolded by goctl. Safe to edit.
// goctl 1.8.5
```

## Why This Matters

1. **Developer Clarity** - Clear indication of which files are safe to modify
2. **Tool Integration** - IDEs and linters can handle generated code appropriately
3. **Code Review** - Reviewers can quickly identify generated vs custom code  
4. **Go Standards** - Follows established Go community conventions for generated code
5. **Consistency** - If some files have generation comments, all should

## Files That Should Have Comments

Based on goctl's behavior (some files get regenerated, others are "generate once"):

**Always Regenerated (DO NOT EDIT):**
- `internal/types/types.go` ✅ (already has it)
- Any other files that get completely overwritten

**Scaffolded Once (Safe to Edit):**
- `internal/handler/*.go`
- `internal/config/config.go`  
- `mcpserver.go`
- `internal/svc/servicecontext.go`
- `internal/logic/*.go` (if generated)

## Version Info
- goctl version: 1.8.5
- go-zero version: 1.9.0

Would appreciate consistent generation comments across all goctl-generated files to improve developer experience and align with Go community standards.
