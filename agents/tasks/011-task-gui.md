# 011 - task gui

the agent task are just markdown.

we can have a datastar GUI that is like Github Issues with the agent/tasks being the store.

this will allow us to run pkg/AI ai agents and have them update the agent/tasks and have the Web GUi update in real time. 

it will mean users can see and edit taks via the Web gui.
