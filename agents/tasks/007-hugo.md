# 007 hugo


hugo is now a service..

we want hugo for our own docs for the Product

we want it for agent docs, tasks. so then when the system is running and the AI updates the agent markodwn, we see it in the runing systems Web GUI for docs.

we want it so that hugo can be part of the Sinlge source philosphy of the system, where markdown is the core Text system, that Deck can use.

there is an idea to mix hugo with datastar, so they we have a Web Based Markdown editor.  This would mean for example that a User can edit markdown via the Web GUI, and the AI can edit markdown via file system, and both would stay in Sync ..

Hugo tailwind might be really usefull to use and its piping system ?

- hugo hugoplate might be able to use that .
- https://github.com/zeon-studio/hugoplate
- it seems to use some shitty npm system currently.


eventually we can have a hugo system where we have a full hugo editor with a web GUI using datastar ?

users can then pick their hugo template, etc 

Deck can be used with it perhaps too. not sure.

also the agent tasks system can eventually be like a github issues list and project backlog system. 

basically we need hugo to be able to work with many source locations at once ? so our docs and the suers own markdown are done by Hugo ?
