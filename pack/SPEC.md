# packaging for js devs

just a proto.

might make this a template for us and them.

I'll help you create an NPM package for your Go binary. Here's a complete implementation:Now you have a complete NPM package setup! Here's what you need to do:

## Setup Steps:

### 1. **Update the configuration:**
- Change `BINARY_NAME` in `install.js` to match your actual binary name
- Update `GITHUB_REPO` in `install.js` to your repository
- Update `name` in `package.json` to your desired NPM package name
- Update the binary name in the GitHub workflow file

### 2. **Directory structure:**
```
your-npm-package/
├── package.json
├── index.js
├── install.js  
├── uninstall.js
├── README.md
├── bin/ (created automatically)
└── .github/workflows/release.yml
```

### 3. **Release process:**
1. Tag your Go project: `git tag v1.0.0`
2. Push the tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build binaries for all platforms
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Publish to NPM

### 4. **Required secrets:**
Add these to your GitHub repository secrets:
- `NPM_TOKEN`: Your NPM authentication token

## Key Features:

- **Cross-platform**: Automatically detects and downloads the right binary
- **Cross-runtime**: Works with Node.js, Deno (with npm compatibility), and Bun
- **Clean installation**: Downloads only what's needed for the current platform
- **Proper cleanup**: Removes binaries on uninstall
- **Error handling**: Helpful error messages for common issues
- **Programmatic access**: Can be used as a library in Node.js

## Testing:

After setup, test with:
```bash
npm pack  # Creates a .tgz file
npm install ./your-package-1.0.0.tgz
npx your-tool --help
```

This approach gives JavaScript developers a familiar installation experience while leveraging your Go binary's performance and capabilities!
