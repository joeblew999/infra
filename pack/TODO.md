# TODO

the gh cli release can be part of our deps.

everything in main.go, needs to be a new pkg/pack

then the pkg/cmd, will need a pack, that is basically a copy of what the main.go in this folder is, but adjusted.

also the constants in this main.go, need obviously be adjsuted too.

the 2 things in the .env, need to be in in root.
