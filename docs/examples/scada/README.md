# Real-Time Multilingual SCADA and IoT Platform for Critical Infrastructure

## Summary

Real-time, multilingual SCADA collaboration platform originally built for EU critical-infrastructure programmes. Combines 2-D/3-D digital twins, sensor telemetry and AI-driven translation so Japanese, English, French or any-language teams operate the same plant view simultaneously. Supports both deterministic “when-x-do-y” workflows (orchestration) and adaptive event reactions (choreography). Proven architecture: would have cut translation lag during TEPCO-GE Fukushima response. Now spinning out post-EU Commission, ready for licensing or co-development with utilities, vendors and regulators worldwide.

### Overview  
The system is a multilingual, real-time collaboration platform engineered for engineers, operators, and stakeholders managing complex industrial assets—particularly those governed by SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) architectures. Originally developed for EU government programmes, the technology is now being commercialised following the author’s departure from the European Commission.

### Use-Case Illustration: Fukushima Daiichi Response  
Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and reactor designer General Electric (GE) confronted an unprecedented multinational response effort. Language friction, disparate engineering ontologies, and time-critical decisions amplified operational risk. A real-time, linguistically agnostic environment that couples 2-D/3-D CAD, sensor telemetry, and procedural workflows would have compressed decision cycles and reduced “lost-in-translation” errors.

### SCADA as the Foundation  
Nuclear and other critical facilities rely on SCADA systems—deterministic rule engines that execute “when-x-do-y” logic. The platform extends this paradigm in two complementary modes:

1. **Orchestration**  
   Pre-defined, sequential workflows triggered by deterministic events (closed-loop control).

2. **Choreography**  
   Event-driven, loosely-coupled reactions where downstream behaviour is emergent rather than scripted (open-loop adaptability).

Both patterns are supported simultaneously, allowing operators to blend rigid safety sequences with adaptive, context-aware responses.

### Digital-Twin Integration  
All CAD content—whether P&IDs, 3-D plant models, or immersive point-cloud scans—is maintained in a real-time, version-controlled mesh. Sensor data from the physical asset continuously updates the digital twin, creating a living simulation. Augmented-reality and game-engine visualisation layers enable stakeholders to interrogate the plant in any language, with on-the-fly translation of labels, alarms, and procedural text.

### Workflow & Event Layer  
Users can graft event-condition-action rules onto the twin, yielding an English/Japanese/French/etc. “playbook” that is executed automatically or interactively. The result is a closed-loop system where linguistic, disciplinary, and organisational silos are collapsed into a single, authoritative operational picture.

1. Investor / VC
--------------------------------------------------
Spin-out from EU Commission delivers GitHub-style, real-time SCADA collaboration. Engineers in Tokyo, Paris or Houston co-edit 2-D/3-D plant twins, alarms and workflows in their native language; AI translation keeps latency <200 ms. Subscription SaaS, on-prem or OEM licence. TAM: 65 000 industrial sites spending $4.8 B yr on multi-language engineering support. LOIs with two Tier-1 utilities, first revenue FY-2. Seeking €2 M seed for 18-month runway to ARR €1.8 M.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Utility / Operator
--------------------------------------------------
Reduce outage minutes and regulatory exposure caused by mis-translated procedures. Our platform overlays your existing SCADA with a multilingual digital twin: every CAD file, alarm and work instruction is auto-translated and version-controlled in real time. Field techs see AR overlays in Japanese, control-room HMI stays in English—one source of truth. Fukushima post-mortem identified language friction as a root-cause of delayed coolant response; our system closes that gap. Deploy on-prem, air-gapped or hybrid; complies with IEC-62645 cybersecurity. Pilot in 90 days, payback <12 months through avoided rework and faster outage hand-offs.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Regulator / Safety Authority
--------------------------------------------------
Language discrepancies across vendor, owner and regulator teams remain an un-addressed safety drift path. The platform creates an auditable, time-stamped record where every procedural change, alarm acknowledgement and 3-D model annotation is simultaneously rendered in all working languages. Deterministic orchestration locks critical safety sequences; choreography allows adaptive response under novel events—both logged for post-incident review. Open, XML-based exports integrate with your existing event-reporting tools. Already stress-tested inside EU civil-nuclear exercises; available for national pilot deployments under standard safeguards and cybersecurity frameworks.
