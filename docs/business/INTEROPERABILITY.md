# Interoperability and Standards Compliance

This document explains how the system uses industry standards and established protocols to ensure compatibility, security, and simplified compliance auditing.

## Design Philosophy

The system is built on proven, widely-adopted standards rather than proprietary protocols. This approach provides:

- **Predictable behavior** using well-documented specifications
- **Easy integration** with existing enterprise systems
- **Simplified security auditing** through standard compliance frameworks
- **Future-proof architecture** that adapts as standards evolve
- **No vendor lock-in** since everything uses open standards

## Industry Standards Used

## No External Dependencies

### Self-Contained Architecture

The system runs completely independently:

**Single Binary Deployment**
- Everything needed is compiled into one executable
- No external runtime requirements beyond the operating system
- No installation of additional software packages required

**Embedded Components**
- Database (SQLite) embedded in the application
- Web server (Caddy) included as library
- Message bus (NATS) runs as embedded service
- Template engines built into the binary

**Standard File Formats**
- Configuration files are standard YAML/JSON
- Templates use standard formats (HTML, CSS, etc.)
- Generated documents use industry-standard formats
- No proprietary file formats that require special tools

### What This Means for Operations

**Simplified Infrastructure**
- No external databases to maintain
- No message brokers to configure
- No web servers to secure separately
- No complex multi-service orchestration

**Reduced Attack Surface**
- Fewer network connections to monitor
- Fewer services to patch and update
- Single process to secure and audit
- Standard protocols make monitoring straightforward
