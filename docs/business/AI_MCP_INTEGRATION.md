# AI MCP Integration - Universal AI Access

**Connect your business system to every AI assistant on every device - mobile, desktop, and web.**

## 🌐 The AI-Everything Future

### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
**MCP** is the universal standard that allows any AI assistant to connect to your business systems.

**Think of it as "USB for AI"** - one protocol that works with:
- 📱 **iPhone Siri** and Android AI assistants
- 💻 **Desktop AI** built into Windows, macOS, Linux
- 🌐 **Web AI** like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
- 🇨🇳 **Chinese AI** in WeChat and Alipay
- 🔮 **Future AI** systems as they emerge

### The Business Revolution
Instead of building separate integrations for each AI platform, **MCP gives you universal AI access**:

```
Your Business System → MCP Protocol → Every AI Assistant
```
