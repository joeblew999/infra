# MCP and Gemini

Intent: mcp-dap-server will help gemini to debug golang.

Its is not tagged, so for now we need to do a go install, but later can use deps pkg to pull the binary for each OS.

To integrate the MCP DAP server with Gemini CLI for debugging your Go applications, you'll need to set up the MCP (Model Context Protocol) DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) server as a bridge between Gemini and Delve (Go's debugger).

Here's how to set this up:

## 1. Install the MCP DAP Server

First, install the MCP DAP server:

```bash
go install github.com/go-delve/mcp-dap-server@latest
```

## 2. Configure Gemini CLI

You'll need to configure Gemini CLI to use the MCP DAP server. This typically involves adding an MCP server configuration to your Gemini settings. Create or update your Gemini configuration file (usually `~/.config/gemini/config.json` or similar):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "go-debug": {
      "command": "mcp-dap-server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Prepare Your Go Application for Debugging

Make sure your Go application is built with debug symbols:

```bash
go build -gcflags="all=-N -l" -o your-app main.go
```

The `-gcflags="all=-N -l"` flags disable optimizations and inlining, making debugging easier.

## 4. Usage Workflow

Once configured, you should be able to:

1. **Start a debug session** through Gemini CLI by referencing the MCP server
2. **Set breakpoints** in your Go code
3. **Inspect variables** and program state
4. **Step through code** execution

## 5. Integration with Your Stack

Given your tech stack (HTMX + Datastar, Pocketbase, NATS JetStream), you'll likely want to debug:

- **Web handlers** serving HTMX responses
- **SSE endpoints** pushing updates from NATS
- **Database operations** with Pocketbase
- **Message handling** from JetStream

The debugger will help you inspect the real-time data flow between these components.

## 6. Testing the Setup

To verify everything works:

1. Start the MCP DAP server
2. Launch Gemini CLI with MCP support
3. Try setting a breakpoint in a simple Go program
4. Verify you can inspect variables and step through code

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this setup, such as configuring breakpoints for your HTMX handlers or debugging the SSE connections with NATS?
