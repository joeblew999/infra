# packaging

Problem:

We need an easy way for nodejs, deno and bun devs be able to run my golang binary.

Solution:

OPTIONS WE HAVE !!

There are several approaches to make your Go binary easily accessible to Node.js, Deno, and Bun developers. Here are the most practical options:

## 1. NPM Package with Binary Distribution

Create an NPM package that downloads and manages your Go binary. This is the most familiar approach for JS developers:

**Package structure:**
```
my-go-tool/
├── package.json
├── index.js
├── install.js
└── bin/
```

**package.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-go-tool",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": {
    "my-tool": "./index.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node install.js"
  }
}
```

**install.js** downloads the appropriate binary based on platform/arch and places it in the `bin/` directory.

**index.js** acts as a wrapper that executes the binary with passed arguments.

## 2. Cross-Runtime Package Manager Support

Publish to multiple registries:
- **NPM** for Node.js users (`npm install my-go-tool`)
- **JSR** for Deno users (`deno add @scope/my-go-tool`)
- **Bun** can use NPM packages natively

## 3. Shell Script Installer

Provide a simple curl-based installer similar to what many Go tools use:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://yoursite.com/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects the platform, downloads the appropriate binary, and adds it to PATH.

## 4. Container/Docker Approach

Provide a Docker image that JS developers can use:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine AS builder
# ... build your app

FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/binary /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["your-binary"]
```

Developers can then run: `docker run your-tool [args]`

## Recommendation

For the best developer experience, I'd suggest **option 1 (NPM package)** because:

- JS developers are already familiar with `npm install`
- Works across all three runtimes (Node.js, Deno with npm compatibility, Bun)
- Handles platform-specific binary distribution automatically
- Can include helpful wrapper functionality
- Easy to version and update
