# Beta Testing Guide

Thank you for participating in the beta testing of the Infrastructure Management System! This guide will help you test the system effectively and report useful feedback.

## üéØ Testing Objectives

We're looking for feedback on:
1. **Ease of setup** - How smooth is the initial experience?
2. **Service reliability** - Do all services start and run consistently?
3. **Web interface usability** - Is the dashboard intuitive?
4. **Documentation clarity** - Are instructions clear and complete?
5. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Does it work on your OS?

## üöÄ Quick Setup Test

### Step 1: Clone and Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeblew999/infra.git
cd infra
go run .
```

**‚è±Ô∏è Expected time**: 30-60 seconds for first startup (downloads dependencies)  
**‚úÖ Success indicator**: You see "üåê Starting web server address=http://localhost:1337"

### Step 2: Verify Services
Open these URLs in your browser:

| Service | URL | Expected Result |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| **Main Dashboard** | http://localhost:1337 | Dashboard with service status |
| **PocketBase Admin** | http://localhost:8090 | Database admin login |
| **Bento Stream UI** | http://localhost:4195 | Stream processing interface |
| **System Status** | http://localhost:1337/status | JSON health status |

### Step 3: Test Shutdown
```bash
go run . shutdown
```
**‚úÖ Success**: All services stop gracefully, no hanging processes

## üß™ Detailed Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-restart Test
Test service resilience:
```bash
go run .                    # Start services
# Wait 30 seconds
^C                          # CTRL+C to interrupt
go run .                    # Start again immediately
go run . shutdown           # Clean shutdown
go run .                    # Start one more time
```

**Expected**: Services should start cleanly each time without port conflicts.

### Scenario 2: CLI Commands Test
Test various CLI operations:
```bash
go run . -h                 # Help should show organized categories
go run . status             # Should show deployment status
go run . config             # Should print current configuration
go run . cli -h             # Should show CLI tools
go run . cli deck -h        # Should show deck commands
```

### Scenario 3: Web Interface Test
Navigate through the web interface:

1. **Dashboard** (http://localhost:1337):
   - Check service status display
   - Navigate to different sections
   - Test any interactive elements

2. **Logs** (http://localhost:1337/logs):
   - Verify log display works
   - Check for any errors in logs

3. **Metrics** (http://localhost:1337/metrics):
   - Confirm metrics are displayed
   - Look for performance indicators

### Scenario 4: Concurrent Usage
Test with multiple terminal windows:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start services
go run .

# Terminal 2: Check status while running
go run . status

# Terminal 3: Try other commands
go run . config
go run . cli deck list
```

## üìù What to Report

### Critical Issues (High Priority)
- **Services fail to start** - Specific error messages
- **Port conflicts** - Which ports are already in use  
- **Web interface not loading** - Browser console errors
- **Shutdown hangs** - Processes that won't stop

### Important Issues (Medium Priority)
- **Slow startup times** - How long it takes
- **UI/UX problems** - Confusing interface elements
- **Documentation gaps** - Missing or unclear instructions
- **CLI command failures** - Commands that don't work

### Nice-to-have Issues (Low Priority)
- **Performance observations** - Memory/CPU usage concerns
- **Feature suggestions** - What would make it better
- **UI improvements** - Design or usability suggestions
